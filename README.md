## 📖 The Story Behind Snake R1

This project was born from a late-night coding session between a human and their AI assistant, exploring the possibilities of the Rabbit R1 device.

It started with a simple question: *"What can we build for this little AI-powered device?"*

The answer: A classic Snake game — reimagined for the Rabbit R1. The game supports both swipe controls (like a phone) and the scroll wheel for flexible gameplay.

What began as a proof-of-concept quickly became a fully playable game, demonstrating that the Rabbit R1 isn't just an AI companion — it's a legitimate platform for custom mini-apps.

**This game represents the democratization of device programming.** Anyone can build for the R1 — you don't need a development kit or special access. Just imagination, an AI assistant, and a willingness to experiment.
